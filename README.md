# GitHub Action for Tekton

This GitHub Action configures [`tkn`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli) in the environment for managing [Tekton](https://tekton.dev/) 
resources in GitHub Actions. 

Tekton is a powerful yet flexible Kubernetes-native open-source framework for creating continuous integration and 
delivery (CI/CD) systems. It lets users build, test, and deploy across multiple cloud providers or on-premises systems 
by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.
